## Tower Autobuild Macro for Fast Villager Defense

This macro is designed to help the player build with maximum efficiency and minimum effort by automating the placement of tower foundations in a repeating "V" pattern.
This method of building is around 1.5x faster than building in straight lines, but is normally very time and focus intensive when done manually. 

How to activate:

1. Download and install AutoHotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download the script tower_autobuild_macro.ahk from this collection
3. Run the script 

Instructions for use:

While the script is running, press the F8 key to enable autobuilding, and press it again to disable. You can change this key in the script.

To autobuild, select your villager, select the tower you want to build, and then click and drag the tower foundations in a straight line (basically the same as how you would build normally).
When you release your mouse button, your cursor will teleport back to the starting point and begin jumping around and rapidly placing foundations. Keep your mouse still until it's done or you'll get a wonky line.
The autobuilding will stop once it reaches roughly where your cursor was previously when you released the mouse button. 

Press the Escape key to interrupt autobuilding. This is useful if you come under attack and need to garrison or run with your villager. 

## Known issues

The autobuilding will occasionally skip tiles. This is mainly caused by lag and will be worse during laggy games, but should happen to no more than around 5% of tiles.
